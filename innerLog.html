<h4>2025-09-26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18:01:08 PM</h4>
Hello.
<br>

<br>
It's Friday evening.  Last Friday in September 2025.  I'm kind of feeling blue and defeated at the moment.  
<br>

<br>
It's just that none of my old friends, or anyone else, have contributed to my federal political campaigns.  I feel rejected on the matter.  And that's OK politically I suppose.
<br>

<br>
The problem is that I have been feeling that all of this rejection and hardship over several decades has been intentional as part of my political traning to be US President.  I can't help but feel that way.  It keeps pushing me forward, but I likely have an ulcer from it now.  I'm paranoid that people are out to physically hurt me and it's like the movie The Predator with how my enemy is invisible.
<br>

<br>
I don't have answers about it, but I feel rejected by it.  I've worked many "normal" jobs in society where people where not paying me for my work.  I'm completely burned out on all of that.  I don't know how to fight it anymore.  I don't know what to do.  I'm not sure I'm willing to do much more than continue to file appeals for SSD.  I enjoy the lawyer training of it.  I feel I deserve it.  It would entirely pay my bills and leave me room to buy some clothing and DVDs.  If I got it, I would be happy and have breathing room to heal.
<br>

<br>
I'd continue my political work most likely, but I will not do any more campaigning efforts on my own.  I mean that this time.  Besides running my website, I won't spend any money on campaigning.  I won't be putting out any more flyers.  I won't be sending out emails.  I will not be doing soliciting of any kind.  Not without a campaign manager who is motivated to make things happen on commission in the beginning.  I have worked many, many jobs where I had to produce a round of work before I get a paycheck.  I will not hire a campaign manager with my own money.  I will not be cold calling.
<br>

<br>
I'm counting on the SSA to do the right thing here so that my mental and physical disability does not become a chronic disablity.  I need time to heal.  It's just like any other occupational hazard/injury.  I'm not an alcoholic trying to get beer money.  I'm a professional business person.  You could aruge that it is simply supply and demand that is the problem here.  My product is either not good enough or there is no need.  Or the location, location, location advertising problem.
<br>

<br>
People need to know that it is difficult and dangerous running for US President.  And not just because of the threat of someone firing a bullet at you.
<br>

<br>
I have my Amazon lists posted on this moth site.  I'm serious about that stuff.  If you want to bring tears of joy to my eyes, I've made it pretty dang easy for you this time.  Most people get paid in cash for their work so they can get what they want instead of barter for it.  And politically I'm suggesting that we are absolutely going to keep new food and clothing going.  I'm suggesting that we are going to slow way down on housing and all kinds of other things, but not clothing and food essentials.  Of course.  And that is primarily what is on my shopping lists.  Sure, that clothing is a little fancy.  But I'm doing massive work over here and that stuff is fairly inexpensive all things considered.
<br>

<br>
I'm into doing this president job, obviously.  But if people don't want me or this is just some kind of clown game show, I'm over it.  I want human decency back in my life and that clothing list is my #1 goal personally.  Of course I will be getting that stuff straight away if I am awarded SSD.  It would be fun to get it from true fans though.  I haven't felt like I've had a fan since high school.  You can do that for me.
<br>

<br>
This compiler is doing a little better.  Getting used to my new home on github.  Thanks Emily for keeping the lights on.  I think you are wonderful of course.  Not sure what all the tension is about.  Of couse it doesn't seem like we are all that compatible as lovers and/or roommates.  I had a wonderful time getting to know you though!  Thanks for coming back into my life :-)

Hmm, clothing.  I often wonder what clothing was like for the masses like 500 years ago?  It's interesting that I'm wearing a dress now just like this.  I first saw this comic in 2020.
<br>

<br>
Also 2020 for the caveman comic.  I just picked up on the 12 on the wall and the $ symbol.  It's all brilliant!  The moving van!

Good morning USA!
<br>

<br>
Um, these are the two main political cartoons that come to my mind.  It's interesting how I have a dress just like that now!  And the caveman grandpa scene is interesting.  Of course an exaggeration.  I think it will be more of a thing of the older people are so well travelled that we'll be telling the younger generation about what we saw because when it comes down to it, we need the products from the transportation machines more than the travel itself.  I'd say that at least half of us are 100% dependent on powered transportation for our daily survival.  If groceries and other things can't get to the stores, and we can't get to the stores too, then we'd simply die.  It's that bad folks.
<br>

<br>
Not overly alarming though. I'm sure we have the smarts and will to keep it going as best as we can.  My dad worked for Pacific NW Bell doing long distance phone and TV communications.  I played a King 2b Libery Trombone.  One of them is in the Hard Rock Cafe on the wall in Sacramento most likely.  I'd like to see that myself one day.  The Liberty Bell curve.  Let Freedom Ring.
<br>

<br>
----
<br>

<br>
One more thing....
<br>

<br>
The nylon stockings are a big deal to me.  Not at all about what I want a potential partner to be like.  It's fully about me.  Patty took me to Victoria's Secret in 2014 for a coming out party/moment and bought me some.  It didn't stick well then.  I wasn't so into that store.  But after Cynthia died in 2019, I immediately bought some and have been wearing them ever since.  There was complete lack of femininity in my social environment growing up until I started dating girls when I was 17 year old.  Sure, there were girls at school, but not in the neighborhood or my family.  After high school, I quickly married Ann and she was in her 30's.  I think I saw her wear a dress twice.  Not that I wanted her to at all!  But she didn't have dresses for me to try on.  I often wore a silk robe around the house.  It was kind of like a minidress and I miss it.
<br>

<br>
Just saying that my transgenderism is totally me and is permanent.  You'd totally make my day by buying me some of those items on my Amazon lists.  The espresso machine is kind of an experiment.  I may not use it much.  I would like a nice machine like that to have coffee once in a while.  It's probably the least important thing to me on all those lists though.  I'd much rather get that Star Wars LEGO Republic Cruiser than the espresso machine.  But the nylons, sweater dresses and heels are at the very top of my list.  Bras too.  Remember, it's about me there.  So I can feel good about myself.  If people think it is funny or kinky or get any enjoyment out of me on those levels at all, I'm down for that!  You know I'll be posting more elegant pictures of myself.  I'm way into it.
<br>

<br>
Still thinking about sexual reassignment surgery too.  It may not be possible at all, but if some people are getting it and I'm a good candidate, then I'm still down for it.  It's highly delusional and stressful, but humans are crazy advanced and we may be doing that kind of thing.  The blood routing may just be impossible though.  Even with the most advanced lasers and technique.  I'm curious and in much more than a textbook kind of way.  You know how I operate.
<br>

<br>
OK!  On with the day!  Feeling a little better over here.  I'm not chasing partners anymore, but if someone latches on to me, I may just accept you into my life.  I don't want to be alone, but I'm way too feminine to be chasing partners no matter what their gender and sexuality is.  I have an empty second bedroom with an ultra soft bed in it.  Also available to give zen meditation and yoga session/lessons.  I'm not advertising that out in town.  It's obvious people know who I am and it's the first thing on my github ms-rand site.  Just email me or even come up to me and say you want a session.  $100.  I need the money just like anyone else.
<br>

<br>
By the way, I did try to get into long distance trucking last fall.  I had an ODOT physical and failed it for mental reasons, so I can't get a CDL driving permit.  Obviously this presidential thinking I'm in does not work well with many jobs.  If it all fizzles out in a couple years, then I may get in a partnership to do a food cart business.  That's my plan.  Not doing that alone.  Not answering someone else's ad.  Not getting into full time software programming in the future.  I don't last long at those jobs.  I'm an excessive thinker and that's ok, right?
<br>

Ah, feeling a little better with this reboot here.
<br>

<br>
Thoughts while I was resting for a few minutes.  There must be some wild men out there who would support me with my clothing list, right?  "Sure, I'll buy Rachel a dress, nylons and pink sandal heels.  And a LEGO Star Wars model!  She'll be doing her at home politics thing, all super happy that someone finally supported her and she'll post all these sexy and/or funny pictures.  Why not?"
<br>

<br>
I've got a lot to say politically obviously, but on some level, I just need to be paid.  Sure, this clothing is fancier than jeans and a T-Shirt.  Do they make this stuff?  It's just a machine, right?  If the machine exists, then they are making it.
<br>

<br>
Just one more thought here.  I have been wondering why these people on the streets, living in tents, are so calm?  Why are they out there?  My feelings on it are that society does not care about them.  They pushed them out there and there must be something in them with their state of despair where they think they deserve that.  Perhaps they didn't work much?  Something like that.
<br>

<br>
When I was out there 22 years ago, I was working on re-educatiing myself massively.  No time to sit around at all.  And if I'm out there now, I'm most likely going to be so flaming mad at it that I'll just go straight to solitary confinement in jail.  I'm just not playing this game anymore.  Just like Richard Pryor in Superman III where he told Mr. Webster of Websco "I know I'm worth more to you doing things out here than in jail doing nothing for nobody."
<br>

<br>
Whatever I'm doing at my place here, it's much, much better than having me in solitary.  In whatever country you send me to in the world.  Wherever you send me, I want a room with my instruments and computer.  If we all have to go without electric, then I'm fine with that.  But if most people have electric, then I demand that and a place to keep my gear out of the rain.  If you can't afford to support me like that, then have some guard spending 10 minutes on me a day assembling a baloney sandwich.  Or flat out kill me.  I'm done with this insanity.

In solitary, I will of course go to court dates to defend myself.  I won't be calling a lawyer or anyone else though.  I'll ask for paper and pen.  Believe be, I've slept on the concrete plenty.
<br>

<br>
OK, anger, frustration.  Just a little histroy lesson.  I don't know.  My food stamp EBT SNAP card has $18.10 on it to last 13 days.  I've got supplies for a couple days here.  At least I have cooking fuel now.  I closed my Dot Trombone bank account and got the $5 back from the savings account deposit for that.
<br>

<br>
It's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be chasing or looking for a partner here.  If someone attaches themselves to me, well that may be something, but it's not going to be me doing the looking anymore.  I'm trying to keep housing, keep productive, keep electric, keep food going and get my clothing list.  I don't care about mansions.  I want clothing for my efforts.  Feminine clothing.  It seems like a bargain.  I'm not the only 55 year old who has been outmoded at work.
<br>

<br>
I guess I'm a little frustrated with the idea of going to bed hungry tonight.  Perhaps I'll splurge a little more on the snack food here.  It's no wonder people working 10 hour days hire an expert to mow their lawn.

<h4>2025-09-22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19:36:22 PM</h4>
With my 26 year old blog and these intense politics going on right now, I have no idea how far I've reached.  It brings up the concepts of how famous musicians play in front of large audiences and travel.  They know absolutely that they have reached those people.  I'm pretty dang clueless about it all.
<br>

<br>
I am still willing to do my solo music and political/comedy show live.  I asked for that online in the fall.  Put out an ad.  I didn't get any tangible response from that.  You can read about the way it's supposed to work in Geddy Lee's <i>My Effin' Life</i> book.  He talks about the role of a young tour manager handling all the arrangements.  It's not like the band is booking all the shows and handling the hotel and travel accomidations.  I'm doing so much to keep my politics together and move it forward.  I'm spread so thin I cannot possibly handle the social dynamics of booking gigs and there is absolutely no way I'm going to start off doing open mics.  Not my scene at all.
<br>

<br>
Not to bring hostility.  My point in this blog reboot is to make some better boundaries about what this is all about.  I'm resolving to focus on energy politics here.  Geography.  Things of a more physical future industrialism nature.  I'm not calling for a revolution, but I am expecting one.  I don't think there is anything anyone can do about it.  If the gas tank is empty, it's empty.  The massive cues I see in my environment and life story seem to indicate that tire rubber is the main thing we are likely to run out of and that will bring this industrialism to an end.  Mostly.
<br>

<br>
We'll still have technology of course.  If we can massively reduce population.  Like in the shape of the Liberty Bell on the top right side, then we should be able to give an amazing life to our future generations.  It's kind of like a cliff, but there is some slope to it.
<br>

<br>
It's likely that we grew the population for many reasons, but the top one was probably that we built the dams and although we could have had a smaller population, a lot of the hyrdoelectric power wouldn't have been utilized had we had a smaller population.  It was a thing of "We are doing it anyway, so let's have a lot of people enjoy it."  It's been an increasingly insane rat race during my lifetime, at least that is what I feel.  But it's also been crazy amazing.  And it feels like we are all going to live some amazing lives the next few decades.
<br>

<br>
If this is all going to happen, the monetary system will be radically different.  And absolutely computerized.  I'm sure it was a massive part of the global order plan and I'm perfect for the role to lead it.  We'll need some better monetary controls than we have had to intelligently distribute the remaining industrial goods of this drawdown system.  We'll be fine.
<br>

<br>
I do fear growing unrest about people having too much time on their hands and wanting to do something more physical, but not having any real building type supplies to do it with.  The good side of that is that there will likely be a lot of people who want to work just to have something to do.  And the people who don't want to do the more physical labor type work, will be able to just kind of kick it.  More and more so the older you are of course because life is just kinda like that.
<br>

<br>
I think what I was suggesting years ago about some kind of draft system to sign people up for a year or two of agricultural work makes sense.  With like a year to study videos to prep for it cause we would want as few managers as possible to cut down on the transportation factor.  It's not exactly unions, right?
<br>

<br>
Healthcare, unions, working wages.  It's all kind of a thing of the past.  Obviously healthcare will always be a big thing.  I think people depend on it too much though.  I've been tortured by excessive counseling.  We'll see where it goes.
<br>

<br>
I could be all wrong about it and/or wrong about my involvement in it.  I simply don't know.  On some level, I'm like any outmoded 55 year old just wanting to retire in some kind of humble abode.  With my musical instruments and computer of course.
<br>

<br>
Thoughts this afternoon of how doing the dishes with water likely uses less transportation than fast food paper wrappers.  I'd say water quality is decreasing across the board.  It's still fine for doing the dishes though.  Not sure.  Just my thoughts today.
<br>

<br>
I could do the RV tour that I keep talking about.  I like the idea and then I'm not attached to it.  I certainly don't want to be homeless again.  It's a serious torture point for me right now.  It may just be a joke.  Just people laughing at me being scared about it.  Or some kind of social experiement on the order of Michael Jackson.  I don't know.  I've been getting increasingly hostile thoughts about it.  I'd rather be in solitary in a jail or prison than on the streets again, so having that plan is giving me a little more sanity.  I don't ever want to be in a mental hospital again.  Those places are absolutely degrading.  People getting paid good money to sit behind glass walls watching me do math and then giving me a $30,000 bill.  Never again.  I'll start fights there until they put me in solitary.  I'm not playing these games anymore.
<br>

<br>
My little shopping list may be a little excessive, but if that clothing exists, I deserve that.  I deserve to stop being tortured.  I've worked a ton in my life and have installed copper pipe, network wires and wires from the pole.  And many more things.  If this presidency thing doesn't work out, then I want to be on SSD for a few years again.  If society is going to continue like this, then give me a few years to recover here.  I may work again.  Probably some food job part time.  I'm likely not going to go to heroics to spend SSD money on my campaign.  I'll contribute $5,000 to my Ms Rand for President to become an official 2028 candidate.  I am already an offical Principle Camapign Committee.  I don't need a state business for that.  I have my EIN and report to the FEC.  I'm not going to buy an RV with SSD money.  I'll have my apartment.  Clothing.  Electric.  Computer.  Bass and keyboard.  SP404.  Mics.  My gear.  I'll continue my blog.  I won't advertise anymore.
<br>

<br>
If I recover and there is still no contibutions, I'll likely find a business partner through the SBA.  Someone younger to do the cooking business with.  That's the proper way to do it.  I can certainly handle the bookwork, but not the social interaction.  I can handle supply.  Help with menu formation.  Take shifts cooking.  I won't do that on my own.  I'm willing to help out like that.
<br>

<br>
I'm no into learning agriculture here.  I'm far too spent intellectually for that.  I'd be great with leading the computer effort as president #48 to ration our industrial output.  I've got a good bead on that.  I don't know what the timing is though.  And my heart just simply isn't with the music scene.  These musicians like Paul McCartney, Sting and others have tortured me through a few of their song lyrics.  It's all been so amazing, but there are a couple things tied heavily to my life and with my transgenderism and rejection of masculinity, I just have no love for playing music with others.  At least for the forseeable future.  If the 2026, 250 year celebration happens, I'd likely just want to stay at home and be on camera relaxing.  People can do their celebration and check in on me on their phone at will.  Whatever I'm doing at home, I'm sure I'd be at my best there.
<br>

<br>
Again, I'm going to mostly stay out of posting about my personal life here.  Been doing that way too much lately.  People have been absusing me about it and I'm completely disgusted with humanity about that.  I assume it was all just a good work as always, so no permanent hard feelings about it.  Just doing my job over here as I understand it.
<br>

<br>
I guess I'll "Insert Into Production" on this lengthy post and check it in the code tomorrow morning.  7:35pm now and it's time for me to get some rest.

It's like, my life story has become a comedy to me.  There is a lot of humor in it and I've certainly been putting that spin on it lately.  But are we done with that now?  Can I have some kind of sane life again where I can do my computer, music and writing thing?  I'm having a lot of joy here coding and playing music.  I'm going to code this reverse post order button again.

This is a common thought of mine: "If people enjoy making fun of me or whatever this is, then I understand that because I like to have fun too.  I would never do this to other people.  My idea of fun is certainly different.  But I do understand fun."

Games.  Solitaire and arcade games.  Actually a lot of games do not have a human opponent.  Twirling a stick usually does not have a human opponent.
